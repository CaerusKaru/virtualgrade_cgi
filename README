VirtualGrade (2.0) by A. Plumer, 6-18-2016
==

This is the initial commit of an upgraded version for C. Gregg's Virtual Grade
online course grading system (originally pilfered from UVA as the legend goes).

Features so far (will be documented in depth at a later date):
* Dynamic grader/admin privileges based on Linux group membership
* Signin using LDAP
* Two supported grading formats: scorecard and pdf
* Scorecard version is a legacy system designed by B. Molay, originally
  implemented using Perl and shell scripts
* PDF version is the offshoot of the original VirtualGrade, with some
  notable enhancements
* Namely: all elements drawn on the PDF are editable later (add/remove/update)
* Ability to publish assignments selectively, with or without comments

To Do:
* Allow portal to assign graders to an assignment on an ad-hoc basis
* Enhance scorecard option to make it easier to leave feedback
* Add score to PDF download on a per-page basis
* Add grader statistics
* Add admin statistics (view grader productivity and course status)
* Add ability to provision assignments, and delete them

Description of technologies:
* The front-end, which is currently a mess, is mostly powered by HTML5, CSS3,
  and jQuery. The end-goal is to convert all of it to AngularJS so that template
  generation is handled exclusively on the front-end (currently handled on back-end)
* Server-side is almost exclusively Python scripts (with the help of some shell
  commands to interact with the file directory)
* While students may submit PDF documents, they are ultimately converted to SVG 1.1
  to allow for easy and dynamic editing by graders. SVG 2.0 would've been preferred
  but it's not ready yet. The SVG is then converted back to PDF when the grading is
  done (thankfully conversion is pretty cheap on the Tufts CS servers)
