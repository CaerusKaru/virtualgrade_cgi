# Notation | Purpose
#    *        Header for section (e.g. 'Content' or 'Modularity')
#    ?        Specific component (e.g. 'under 80 lines')
#   [n]       Total points for a component (default is one)
#   {n}       Extra credit points for a component (not part of total score)

# Notes: total score does not need to be included, it will be
#        calculated on the fly. Also, blankspaces between
#        sections are fine and will be ignored (see below)
